Provides for managing context within message exchanges.  {@link org.jibx.ws.context.ExchangeContext} contains the 
context for a complete message exchange, while {@link org.jibx.ws.context.InContext} and 
{@link org.jibx.ws.context.OutContext} contain the context for processes of a 
single message in an inbound and outbound direction respectively.
<p>
The context classes are not thread-safe. They are serially reused, with the <code>reset()</code> method being
called between each use.
